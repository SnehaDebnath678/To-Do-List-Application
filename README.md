# To-Do-List-Application

This project is a fully functional To-Do List web application with interactive features, local storage support, and a clean, responsive UI.

### Functionality Overview:

1. **Add Tasks**:

   * You can type a task into the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the task list.
   * Example: Typing "First task" and clicking Add will add it to the list.

2. **Task Completion**:

   * Clicking on any task marks it as completed.
   * The text is struck through, and a green checkmark appears.
   * Clicking again toggles the task back to incomplete.

3. **Delete Tasks**:

   * A cross (X) button appears on the right of each task.
   * Clicking this button removes the task from the list.

4. **Persistent Storage**:

   * All tasks are stored in local storage.
   * Even after refreshing the page, tasks remain saved.
   * Tasks retain their completion status (checked/unchecked).

5. **UI Features**:

   * The layout is responsive with a card-style to-do box.
   * A linear gradient background gives a clean, modern look.
   * Smooth transitions and user-friendly input/output.

### Use Case Walkthrough:

* You enter a task like "Drink water" and click Add.
* The task appears in the list. Click on it to mark as completed.
* Click again to mark it as not completed.
* Click the X to delete it.
* Add more tasks like "Eat food" or "Do homework".
* Refresh the browser: all tasks persist with the same status.

### Technologies Used:

* HTML5 for structure
* CSS3 for styling and animations
* JavaScript for interactivity and data management
* LocalStorage API for saving data persistently

This project is great for understanding how to build dynamic front-end apps and manage state using local storage.
